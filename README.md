# Face Recognition System

A powerful and easy-to-use Face Recognition System that can detect, recognize, and verify human faces in images and videos using deep learning techniques.

## 📌 Features

- Face detection using Haar Cascades or MTCNN
- Face recognition using deep learning (e.g., FaceNet or dlib)
- Real-time recognition via webcam
- Face dataset creation from images/videos
- Easy-to-use CLI and GUI (optional)
- Logging and reporting of recognized faces

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV  
- dlib / face_recognition  
- NumPy  
- Flask (for web-based interface, optional)
- Tkinter (for desktop GUI, optional)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition-system.git
cd face-recognition-system
2. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the System
To recognize faces in real-time:
bash
Copy
Edit
python recognize.py
To add a new face to the dataset:
bash
Copy
Edit
python add_face.py --name "John Doe"
🧠 How It Works
The system captures or loads an image/video.

It detects faces using OpenCV/dlib.

Extracted faces are encoded into numerical embeddings.

These embeddings are compared with known faces in the dataset.

Recognition results are displayed in real-time.
